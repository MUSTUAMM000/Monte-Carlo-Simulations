# Monte-Carlo-Simulations
Scenario #1: Slice of a Pie
Objective: Estimate the value of π using a Monte Carlo simulation.
Process:
Consider a 2x2 square on the coordinate plane and generate random points within it.
Count how many points fall inside the unit circle (center at (0,0), radius=1).
Record the ratio of points inside the circle to total points.
Outcome: The last ratio, when multiplied by 4, approximates the value of π.
Result: The final ratio multiplied by 4 is approximately 3.14.


Scenario #2: A Three-Way Tie
Objective: Determine the probability that the Cardinals, Brewers, and Cubs all have the same number of wins after a set of games.
Process:
Simulate game outcomes using coin flips for remaining games.
Increment wins for each team based on the simulated outcomes.
Check if the Cardinals, Brewers, and Cubs have the same number of wins.
Outcome: Probability of all three teams having the same wins after the games.
Result: The estimated probability is approximately 2.42%.




Scenario #3: A Trivia Game
Objective: Estimate probabilities for different outcomes in a trivia game between two contestants.
Process:
Simulate 30 questions, considering buzzing in and correct answers.
Compare scores to determine game outcomes.
Outcomes:
Probability that contestant A wins.
Probability that contestant B wins.
Probability of a tie.
Results:
Probability that A wins: approximately 50.46%.
Probability that B wins: approximately 40.83%.
Probability of a tie: approximately 8.71%.
